# ChessCyvasseAndMore
More or less a test project for get a simple understanding of how Dapp interactions could work. It will be a simple game at the beginning of probably just chess but if people like the idea and want to help fund the development I had ideas for a conquest mode, hex chess, and potentially Cyvasse (Song of Ice &amp; Fire game similar to chess) with multiple variants.
